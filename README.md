# 🏡 Real Estate Data Analysis & Visualization

This project involves **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** and **visualization** on a real estate dataset using Python libraries like **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, and **Seaborn**. The goal is to uncover insights about property prices, locations, types, and other key features through visual storytelling.

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains information on real estate properties including:

- Transaction Date
- House Age
- distance To the nearest Mart
- Number of convenience Store
- Latitued
- Longitude
- House Price Per Unit Area

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** – for data manipulation and cleaning  
- **NumPy** – for numerical operations  
- **Matplotlib** – for basic plotting and visual customization  
- **Seaborn** – for advanced statistical visualizations

---

## 📊 Data Analysis & Visualizations

The following analyses and visualizations were performed:

### 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Handling missing values using mode and mean
- Data type corrections
- Summary statistics and distribution checks

### 📈 Visualizations

- **Histogram** of property prices to view distribution
- **Box plots** to detect outliers in price and area
- **Bar plots** showing average price per location
- **Scatter plot** of area vs. price
- **Heatmap** to analyze correlation between numerical features

---

## 📌 Key Insights

- Certain locations have significantly higher average property prices.
- Most properties are unfurnished or semi-furnished.
- Outliers in property price and area may affect model performance and need treatment.
- Positive correlation exists between area and price, as expected.
